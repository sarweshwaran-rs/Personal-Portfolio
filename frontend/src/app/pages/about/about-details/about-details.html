<p>
    I'm <strong>Sarweshwaran R S</strong>, a final-year Software Engineering student at
    <a href="https://www.vit.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)</a>,
    with a strong foundation in modern software development principles and technologies.
    I'm deeply passionate about backend development, AI/ML projects, and exploring different operating systems.
    Through academic projects and personal initiatives, I've built applications, developed AI models,
    and explored multiple domains in software engineering.
</p>

<p>
    My journey began with building a <em>Java Swing-based Gym Management System</em> as my first academic project,
    which strengthened my understanding of Java and GUI development. Since then, I’ve worked on several full-stack
    projects
    using React, Node.js, Express, and Spring Boot—focusing on designing reliable APIs and integrating databases such as
    MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Firestore. I’ve also gained practical experience with AWS cloud services
    and streamlined my workflows using Git and GitHub.
</p>

<p>
    During my academic career, I published a research paper in an <em>IGI Global book chapter</em> on plant disease
    classification,
    and I've also earned the <strong>Microsoft Azure AI-900 Fundamentals</strong> certification.
    I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient, and reusable code that makes development smoother.
    I love exploring technology in depth, continuously learning, and applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems.
    I'm currently seeking opportunities to contribute my skills in a professional environment and grow as an aspiring
    software engineer.
