                I'm Sarweshwaran R S, a final-year Software Engineering student at <a
                    href="https://www.vit.ac.in">Vellore Institute of Technology(VIT)</a>, with a
                strong foundation in modern software devleopment principles and technologies. I'm deeply passionate
                about backend development, AI/ML projects, and
                exploring different operating systems. Through academic projects and personal interests, I've built
                applications, developed AI Models, and explored
                multiple domains in software engineering.

                My journey began with building Java Swing-based Gym Management System as my first academic project,which
                strengthened my understanding of Java and GUI
                development. Since then, I've worked on several full-stack projects using React, Node.js, Express
                server, focusing on designing reliable API's, and
                integrating databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Firestore. I've also gained practical
                experience with AWS cloud services and streamlined
                my workflows using Git and GitHub.
            </li>

            <li>
                During my academic career, I have published a research paper in an IGI Global Scientific Publishing's
                book chapter on plant disease classification, and
                I've also earned the Microsoft Azure AI fundamentals (AI-900) certification. I'm passionate about
                writing clean, efficient, and reusable code that makes
                development smoother. I love exploring technology in depth, continuously learning and applying my
                knowledge to solve real-world problems. I'm currently
                seeking opportunities to contribute my skills in a professional environment and grow as an aspiring
                software engineer.
